Apple has once again refreshed its AirPods lineup, introducing the AirPods 4 in 2024. These earbuds come in two versions, catering to both standard users and those seeking advanced features like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC).

The base model is priced at $129, while the ANC-equipped version is $179​

Both models have a refined design, which Apple claims offers a superior fit thanks to extensive ear shape data mapping. The AirPods 4 maintains an open-ear design similar to previous iterations, offering comfort but without customisable ear tips. However, the ANC version includes ear tips for a sealed fit, optimizing noise cancellation.

In terms of sound quality, Apple promises "massive improvements" due to an all-new internal acoustic architecture, featuring a low-distortion driver and dynamic amplifier​.

These upgrades should provide clearer, more immersive audio, keeping the AirPods 4 competitive in the rapidly evolving wireless earbud market.

While the AirPods 4 have retained many design elements from earlier models, they come equipped with modern essentials. Both versions feature force-sensor controls and Siri integration, but lack on-bud volume adjustment—a feature some users hoped for. Instead, users will need to control volume via their connected devices.

The introduction of USB-C ports in the charging cases aligns with Apple's move toward universal charging across its devices. Battery life remains robust, with up to 30 hours total from the case, though ANC reduces the listening time to around four hours on a single charge.​

Overall, the AirPods 4 blend Apple's signature minimalist design with key functional upgrades, making them an appealing choice for users seeking comfort and performance. Whether for everyday use or noise-canceling needs, they continue to build on Apple's reputation for delivering high-quality wireless audio experiences.
